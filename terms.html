            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to DND Global Logistics Limited ("DND", "we", "our", or "us"). These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your access to and use of our website, digital platforms, and logistics services, including but not limited to courier services, haulage, freight forwarding, warehousing, vehicle hire, and related logistics solutions (collectively, the "Services").</p>
            <p>By accessing our website, requesting a pickup, engaging our Services, or otherwise dealing with DND, you ("Customer", "User", or "you") acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must refrain from using our website or engaging our Services.</p>
            <p>These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and DND Global Logistics Limited and apply to all service requests, transactions, and interactions unless expressly varied by a written agreement executed by DND.</p>

            <h2>2. Amendments and Updates to the Terms</h2>
            <p>DND Global Logistics Limited reserves the right to amend, modify, or update these Terms at any time at its sole discretion. Any such amendments shall take effect upon publication on our website or upon notification to you by electronic or other reasonable means. Where you continue to access our website or use our Services after the effective date of any amendment, such continued use shall constitute your acceptance of the revised Terms. It is your responsibility to review the Terms periodically for updates.</p>

            <h2>3. Service Provision and Scope</h2>
            <p>DND provides logistics solutions including pick-up and delivery services, transportation of goods via road and other means, freight management, and third-party logistics. The scope of Services provided shall be as specified in individual service requests, waybills, or contracts.</p>

            <h2>4. Service Requests and Bookings</h2>
            <p>All service requests are subject to acceptance by DND. We reserve the right to refuse the carriage of any shipment at our sole discretion, particularly where such shipment poses a security risk, contains prohibited items, or violates applicable laws. A booking is deemed confirmed only when an official DND waybill or tracking ID has been generated.</p>

            <h2>5. Accurate Information and Customer Responsibility</h2>
            <p>The Customer shall provide accurate and complete information regarding the nature, weight, dimensions, value, and destination of the goods. DND shall not be liable for delays, losses, or additional costs arising from incorrect or incomplete information provided by the Customer. The Customer warrants that they are the legal owner of the goods or have the requisite authority to engage DND for the carriage of the goods.</p>

            <h2>6. Packaging Requirements</h2>
            <p>It is the Customer's responsibility to ensure that all goods are adequately and securely packaged to withstand the normal rigours of transportation and handling. DND reserves the right to refuse any shipment that is inadequately packaged. DND shall not be liable for damage resulting from insufficient or defective packaging.</p>

            <h2>7. Prohibited and Restricted Items</h2>
            <p>Customers are strictly prohibited from tendering for carriage any item classified as "Prohibited Items" under Nigerian Law or DND's internal policies. These include, but are not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Illegal drugs, narcotics, and psychotropic substances.</li>
                <li>Explosives, firearms, ammunition, and hazardous materials.</li>
                <li>Perishable goods (except by special written agreement).</li>
                <li>Live animals, human remains, or illegal wildlife products.</li>
                <li>Currency, bullion, precious stones, or high-value negotiable instruments (unless specially declared and insured).</li>
                <li>Any other items prohibited by the Nigerian Customs Service, NDLEA, or other regulatory authorities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>DND reserves the right to dispose of or hand over to law enforcement any prohibited items found in its possession without liability to the Customer.</p>

            <h2>8. Right to Inspect</h2>
            <p>DND Global Logistics Limited and regulatory authorities (including but not limited to the Police, NDLEA, and Customs) reserve the right to open and inspect any shipment without prior notice to the Customer to ensure safety, security, and compliance with the law.</p>

            <h2>9. Fees, Charges, and Payment Terms</h2>
            <p>Service fees are calculated based on weight, dimensions, distance, and the type of service requested. Rates are subject to change without notice due to fluctuations in operational costs. All payments must be made in full before or upon delivery as specified at the time of booking. DND shall have a general lien on all goods in its possession for all charges and expenses due from the Customer.</p>

            <h2>10. Taxes and Duties</h2>
            <p>The Customer is responsible for all applicable taxes, customs duties, and regulatory levies associated with the shipment. DND may, at its discretion, pay such duties on behalf of the Customer and shall be entitled to full reimbursement before delivery.</p>

            <h2>11. Delivery and Undelivered Shipments</h2>
            <p>DND will make reasonable efforts to deliver shipments within the estimated timelines. However, delivery times are not guaranteed. If a shipment cannot be delivered due to incorrect address, absence of the recipient, or refusal to accept, DND will attempt to contact the Customer. Additional storage and re-delivery fees may apply. Shipments unclaimed for over 30 days may be disposed of or sold to recover costs.</p>

            <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, DND's liability for loss, damage, or delay is limited to the declared value of the goods or a maximum cap set by DND policies, whichever is lower. DND shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential losses, including loss of profits or business opportunities.</p>

            <h2>13. Force Majeure</h2>
            <p>DND shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations where such failure results from circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, civil unrest, strikes, fuel shortages, government restrictions, extreme weather, or infrastructure failure.</p>

            <h2>14. Insurance and Extended Liability</h2>
            <p>DND does not provide automatic all-risk insurance. Customers are strongly encouraged to obtain independent insurance for high-value items. DND may offer "Extended Liability" coverage for an additional fee, subject to specific terms and conditions.</p>

            <h2>15. Claims Process</h2>
            <p>Any claim for loss or damage must be submitted in writing to DND within fourteen (14) days of the delivery date or the date the delivery was expected. Claims must be accompanied by proof of value and evidence of damage. Failure to submit a claim within this period shall constitute a waiver of the claim.</p>

            <h2>16. Use of Digital Platforms</h2>
            <p>Users agree to use our website and tracking portals only for lawful purposes. Unauthorized access, hacking, or interference with our digital systems is strictly prohibited and will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.</p>

            <h2>17. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>All content on DND's platforms, including logos, trademarks, text, and software, is the property of DND Global Logistics Limited and is protected by intellectual property laws. No part of our platforms may be reproduced without prior written consent.</p>

            <h2>19. Termination</h2>
            <p>DND reserves the right to terminate or suspend access to its Services or digital platforms at any time without notice for conduct that violates these Terms or is harmful to DND's business interests.</p>

            <h2>20. Indemnity</h2>
            <p>The Customer agrees to indemnify and hold DND Global Logistics Limited and its officers harmless from any claims, losses, or damages arising from the Customer's breach of these Terms or the nature of the goods tendered for carriage.</p>

            <h2>21. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
            <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms or the Services shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.</p>

            <h2>22. Severability and Waiver</h2>
            <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. No failure or delay by DND in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver of such right.</p>
