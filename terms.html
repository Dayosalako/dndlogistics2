        By engaging the services of DND Global Logistics Ltd (RC: 9133502), the Sender agrees to these Terms and Conditions. These terms are aligned with international logistics standards for safety, liability, and transparency.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Nature of Services</h2>
      <p>DND Global Logistics Ltd provides national and international courier, haulage, and freight forwarding services. We act as a professional intermediary between the sender and the final destination, utilizing a network of road, air, and sea transport.</p>

      <h2>2. Prohibited & Restricted Items</h2>
      <p>The Sender warrants that the shipment does not contain prohibited items. Prohibited items include, but are not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Illegal drugs, narcotics, and psychotropic substances.</li>
        <li>Hazardous materials (explosives, flammable liquids, radioactive materials).</li>
        <li>Currency, bullion, or negotiable instruments.</li>
        <li>Live animals or human remains.</li>
        <li>Perishable goods (unless specifically agreed upon for refrigerated haulage).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Packaging & Labeling</h2>
      <p>It is the Sender's responsibility to ensure that goods are properly packaged to withstand the rigors of transit. DND Global Logistics is not liable for damage resulting from inadequate or improper packaging provided by the sender.</p>

      <h2>4. Customs & International Trade</h2>
      <p>For cross-border shipments, the Sender is solely responsible for providing accurate documentation and for the payment of all customs duties, taxes, or levies. DND Global Logistics reserves the right to charge for administrative costs related to customs clearance delays caused by incomplete documentation.</p>

      <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>Our liability is strictly limited to direct loss and damage only. To the extent permitted by Nigerian law and international treaties (e.g., Warsaw Convention), DND Global Logistics is not liable for:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><b>Indirect Losses:</b> Loss of profit, income, interest, or future business.</li>
          <li><b>Force Majeure:</b> Damage caused by natural disasters, war, strikes, or civil unrest.</li>
          <li><b>Electronic Data:</b> Loss of or damage to magnetic/electronic records.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Insurance</h2>
      <p>Standard shipping does not include full-value insurance. Senders are strongly advised to purchase independent cargo insurance or request an "Extended Liability" coverage from us at an additional premium for high-value items.</p>

      <h2>7. Right to Inspect</h2>
      <p>DND Global Logistics and regulatory authorities (NDLEA, Customs, etc.) have the right to open and inspect any shipment without prior notice to ensure compliance with safety and security regulations.</p>

      <h2>8. Claims Process</h2>
      <p>Any claim for loss or damage must be submitted in writing within fourteen (14) days from the date of delivery. Failure to report within this timeframe constitutes a waiver of the claim.</p>
